I've been lucky to be a part of some great collaborations with incredibly talented people. Here are just a few of my favorite projects.

## Edible Arrangements Mobile Design 
<i>iOS, Android, Mobile Web, Desktop Web</i>

The Edible Arrangements mobile apps and websites were designed to help customers find the perfect gift for the right occasion. With an eye to consumer gifting behavior, my team created a "Gift Finder" recommendation tool and a streamlined ordering experience so users can send thoughtful fruit arrangements with just a few taps. The design project spanned four different platforms: iOS, Android, mobile web, and desktop web.

The Lilly Pulitzer iOS app was designed with the core Lilly consumer in mind, providing her with a streamlined native checkout experience and mobile-specific features for delightful, on-the-go shopping. I worked with a full product team spanning strategy, UX, design, and engineering to kick off the project, launch a V1, and iterate beyond the initial MVP to launch versions 2 and 3.

When 85 Broads rebranded as Ellevate, the global professional women's network sought a redesigned visual identity and robust new website to accompany the organization's shift. Incorporating agile processes, I worked with a team of UX/visual designers and developers on building a Ruby on Rails membership app that could support Ellevate's globally distributed chapters and events as well as serve a wide range of editorial and video content.

Shake is a technology platform that offers legal assistance and resources to consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. By redesigning their marketing site with an eye toward increasing app signups as well as highlighting their blog as a trusted source of legal advice, my team was able to help Shake promote its mission of making the law accessible for everyone.
