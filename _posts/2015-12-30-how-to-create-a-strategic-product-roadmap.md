Our product teams are continually discovering new opportunities to help define long-term mobile strategies with our partners. For product managers especially, extending projects past the first version can mean an exciting chance to augment what the team has already built and define the future of the product. With new feature “nice-to-haves” coming from all angles and ever-evolving mobile technologies, the path forward is not always clear.

In order to help our partners navigate the next big opportunities in the mobile space, we begin by crafting a **strategic product roadmap**. This document describes the product’s high-level objectives and the path to realizing those ideas.

Here are some helpful tips on creating a product roadmap to bring your team’s ideas together into one compelling product vision.


**Define Your Goals** 

Always start with your goals. The most important aspect of product management is working with stakeholders to identify business and user goals and continuously revisit them with the product team during each stage of the product development process.

_Business Goals:_ If you’ve already worked with your product team to create a set of business goals, consider revisiting them for your next project. Begin by outlining general business objectives and work your way to the more specific goals. Drawing from the framework below, identify broader goals, drill into a few specific KPIs that will measure the success of the product, and write down a figure your team will target.

_User Goals:_ Team up with a UX Researcher to observe the product’s target audience in the field and leverage initial user interviews to uncover behaviors and pain points. Notice how users are currently using existing solutions to address their needs, and identify what it is the target user is ultimately trying to accomplish.

Keep these stated goals top-of-mind while formulating a roadmap; these will be the key deciding factors of what makes it into a future release and what doesn’t. Ideally, every product decision the team makes hits the sweet spot where business and user goals overlap.  

**Brainstorm Around Themes** 

Since a roadmap is meant to be a communication tool above all else, it should tell a compelling story. One simple way to do this is to roadmap and brainstorm with the team around themes. The best themes come from the partner’s identified goals and the main problems they want to solve. Find the thread that ties together your proposed ideas, and you’ll find that you’ll be better able to speak to the why behind what you’re building down the road. Having a common thread to appeal to will also guide future decisions and is helpful when there isn’t an obvious directive.

At Prolific, roadmaps are the product of the entire team’s input. When we brainstorm, we want to pool together ideas coming from every member of the team (including our partners!) as each discipline lends itself to seeing the product from a different angle. We get together and whiteboard our ideas for the product’s future. The sky’s the limit, and no idea is too outlandish. 

**Collect and Categorize Ideas**

Once you’ve explored all the possibilities in your roadmap brainstorm, it’s beneficial to categorize them to determine their priority. Using a framework our Strategy team has dubbed the “**5 Wells of Inspiration**,” we can classify each potential idea into a larger bucket. This helps the product manager populate a “Roadmap Backlog” that contains ideas for your upcoming release and future ones. I’ve provided an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k5l_dfoQqvPPRX1ZO86CSAEtPALhXTq-zZyidPKzi1U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">example spreadsheet</a> to use as the foundation of your own Roadmap Backlog, which you should feel free to customize to suit your team’s needs.

Your roadmap might be a combination of ideas from any of these sources: 

1. ***User Research and Feedback***<br>
This Well of Inspiration houses ideas is collected by your UX Designer, who has a firm grasp on what the app’s core users expect to see in your next release, and how they relate to your overall goals. Through weekly testing sessions that target product discovery and usability, we’re able to watch users interact with our apps to identify behaviors and pain points, as well as listen to their suggestions. Additionally, once we’ve released an app into the wild, we open up the doors for feedback through App Store and Google Play Store reviews or through customer messaging platforms we’ve built into the app. At Prolific, it’s up to our UX Designers to collect this user feedback and separate signal from the noise. 

2. ***Quantitative Insights / KPI Target Gap Analysis***<br>
A few months post-launch is one of the best times to let the data speak and see if your product measured up to the KPI targets that you’d set in the very beginning of your project. At that point, you’ve most likely collected enough data to form a baseline for preparing the targets for your next roadmap and to re-calibrate the ones that you’d initially set. A product analyst can help provide the necessary insight for helping your team decide what roadmap additions can move the needle. From there, you can hypothesize what kinds of initiatives might help get you there. If the problem is known but the solution not yet clear, this roadmap item could even start as an initial strategic offering (e.g. “Audit of checkout flow and recommendation for reducing drop-off rate”) that ultimately becomes a feature idea in a later iteration (e.g. “Implement Apple Pay”). 

3. ***Technology Evolution***<br>
Involve your engineers early in the roadmapping and product discovery process. You’ll not only come out with more accurate initial assessments of the time and resources necessary to execute your roadmap, but also you’ll find your engineers will often be the source of some cutting-edge feature ideas. As a mobile-first company, our team is always paying attention to new technologies that we could potentially leverage. Though sometimes our partners come to us for advice on how to jump on the “next big thing,” we’re also able to speak to subtler innovations lying under the hood. A recent example of this was the advent of iOS 9, which led a few of our iOS engineers to suggest iOS 9-specific features such as Search and Universal Links that could potentially bring enormous value to the product.

4. ***Partner Brand Initiatives***<br>
Occasionally, our partners will approach us with a new business initiative that they would like to see reflected in the product, such as creating an area in the app to showcase seasonal promotions and content, or adding a new category to house the latest product line. Shifts in business priorities or in the organization can suddenly mean senior stakeholders requesting major changes in your mobile app. As with all of the five Wells, it’s up to the product manager to thoughtfully take these ideas into account and also determine their priority in the roadmap.

5. ***Technical Debt, Bugs, and Polish***<br>
Technical debt acquired from earlier quick-and-dirty fixes, bugs from new code breaking legacy code, improvements to existing features, and design polish should all be documented and prioritized into the roadmap. After a release, the product manager should have a great sense of what the team could have addressed earlier but had to postpone.	

Diversifying by considering all five Wells will help create a well-balanced roadmap that can address both the previous technical debt or app improvements, as well as the innovative new features that could push the product forward.

**Consider Level of Effort and Dependencies**

Now that you have a laundry list of features with larger themes connecting the dots, you should begin to converge on what is most feasible to approach from a technical standpoint. While nearly every partner would prefer to have the product release out sooner than later, you should think about how the product would be affected by technical limitations, third parties, and other risks that come from working with different players. Identifying dependencies early on in the roadmap will not only help with sequencing each phase of development, but also with communicating to stakeholders in the event that blockers occur and require a pivot in the roadmap.

The more dependencies that exist, or the greater the uncertainty involved in working on it, the higher the level of effort. Consider each roadmap idea against a matrix of impact vs. effort, with effort including the number of dependencies. In sequencing your collected roadmap candidates, the best ideas to tackle first will be the ones that have high impact and low effort.

**Write It All Out, Then Communicate**

If you’ve gone through the process of forming goals, brainstorming ideas with your team, consolidating and prioritizing those ideas, and considering dependencies, you’re now ready to document and communicate your roadmap widely to the product team and stakeholders. Write out each proposed addition to your roadmap, whether it’s a new feature or a larger strategic effort, and bolster each one with your team’s rationale on why you’re building it, the goals and KPIs you’re targeting, and the level of effort involved. Document this vision in any quickly digestible format that can be shared easily and frequently with the team—this might be a Gantt chart, or even a simple Google Doc.

Just remember not to overdo it; ultimately, the point of a roadmap is to create a cohesive vision that aligns the team and stakeholders on what lies ahead. Though we use Gantt charts to help us illustrate and communicate the execution of our roadmaps, the roadmap itself is not about the feature backlog, release dates, estimates, or the individual tasks, nor is it a mere Statement of Work that lists specific deadlines, resourcing, and deliverables.

In its essence, a roadmap is a strategic document that encapsulates what the team wants to accomplish together. It’s a “true north” with a clear purpose meant to be shared and understood at a glance. Following these tips to incorporate input from the team is a great way to assemble around the common purpose of delivering the best product possible.
