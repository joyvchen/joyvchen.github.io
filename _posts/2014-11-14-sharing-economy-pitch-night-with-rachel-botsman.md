title: Sharing Economy Pitch Night with Rachel Botsman
---

The other night, I had the opportunity to see Rachel Botsman, co-author of <a href="http://www.rachelbotsman.com/book/" target="_blank"><i>What’s Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption</i></a> and prominent sharing economy innovator, speak for <a href="http://www.letscollaboratenyc.com/2014/10/11/ny-sharing-economy-pitch-night" target="_blank">Let’s Collaborate NYC</a> on how the socioeconomic phenomenon is transforming the way we live, work, and consume. She’s spoken on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption/" target="_blank">TED</a> before, but I thought that this fireside chat with Wrede Petersmeyer of Airbnb offered a more intimate setting to clarify some points about collaborative consumption, not to mention it was pretty neat to sit just a few feet in front of a thought leader I admire. At the end, Katie Bolin of Spark Capital also led a startup pitch session, featuring local NYC early-stage startups operating within the space: <a href="http://www.farmigo.com" target="_blank">Farmigo</a>, <a href="http://www.gopicsell.com" target="_blank">PicSell</a>, <a href="http://www.sailo.co" target="_blank">Sailo</a>, <a href="http://www.sparehire.com" target="_blank">SpareHire</a>, <a href="http://www.elevenjames.com" target="_blank">Eleven James</a>, and <a href="http://www.sparechair.me" target="_blank">SpareChair</a>. Incredibly cool to see some local companies participate in this larger global movement.

**What is Collaborative Consumption?**

Rachel kicked off the discussion with a few quips about the incredibly wide web of language surrounding collaborative consumption, citing phrases such as the sharing economy, peer-to-peer economy, collaborative economy, and mesh economy that people use to describe this idea. Ironically, the sharing economy lacks a shared definition, which Rachel describes in an <a href="http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/2013/11/22/the-sharing-economy-lacks-a-shared-definition/" target="_blank">article</a> of the same name. In it, she offers that though these ideas are different, they fundamentally do overlap in areas, but for the sake of the event and the blog post, we’d focus on the <i>general</i> space of collaborative consumption. So what’s that all about?  

Collaborative consumption, as Rachel describes, is at its core an ideology that promotes consumption not just through buying, but also through sharing, bartering, trading, and renting. It is a macro-shift in which we are no longer passive consumers but instead actively taking underutilized assets and putting them into a marketplace that promotes shared use. A move toward the collaborative economy touches practically every industry, though it particularly affects organizations and verticals where trust relationships are rapidly changing.

**What is it not? Myths About Collaborative Consumption**

With the Uberfication of everything — that is, a rising mobile services market fueled by Uber-style technology that buys you time and saves you effort — many believe that the collaborative consumption movement revolves around on-demand consumer services. Rather, Rachel contends that this is a myth — collaborative consumption is not about "on-demand." Though she didn’t elaborate much on this viewpoint at the event, I believe what she meant here is that Uber’s goal is to connect riders and drivers for on-demand ride-sharing. It has also spawned many similar on-demand services that pick up your dry cleaning or bring your Thai takeout order to you within 90 minutes. But the true end goal of the sharing economy is less about instant gratification than it is about shoring up underutilized assets and putting them into circulation, as well as empowering micro-entrepreneurs to engage in a new kind of marketplace — the key word being *empowering*. I love this quote I found later from her TED talk: “At its core, it’s about empowerment. It’s about empowering people to make meaningful connections, connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we’ve lost somewhere along the way, by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter, like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions.” 

Another myth about the sharing economy is that startups are intentionally trying to attack incumbent industries; however, Rachel argues that this is simply “the new normal,” the result of a natural technological progression. She added that incumbents typically react in one of three ways: 

1) **Ostriches**, who simply hope that the disruption will go away, or don’t acknowledge that the change is happening<br>
2) **Fighters**, who try to bring new ideas down and protest the actions of disruptors with regulation <br>
3) **Pioneers**, who embrace disruption and invest in disrupters, form partnerships, or invest in innovation of their own

**Trust and Privacy in the Sharing Economy**

One big topic looming on my mind about the sharing economy was the question of trust, privacy, and transparency, now that so many sharing economy services rely on the public collection of ratings about your personal trustworthiness, cleanliness, and professional demeanor. With new kinds of relationships brought on by the sharing economy, we exchange trust instead of money. Yet your Airbnb reviews can paint either a positive or damning picture of how you make your private home, and Uber ratings shed light on your ability behind the wheel. So isn’t that a little scary, that your information isn't at all private anymore and your ability to operate within this new schema is based on compiled data of how your peers think of you? Reputation data has become the new currency scaling communities built upon trust, making résumés and credit histories seem like an archaic relic of the past. In short, we aren’t able to hide behind the internet’s thin veil of anonymity — that doesn’t exist, at least not anymore (Aside: I recently read a <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21625801-forecasting-internets-impact-business-proving-hard-pointers-future" target="_blank">great article</a> about the promise of the Internet that it couldn’t keep. More on that another time.)   

The upside? Rachel says that the more data we can collect of our own reputation histories, the more we can actually control it. (There is now even a secondary market around that trust, with new startups built on harnessing and monitoring this information for individual use. Check out <a href="http://www.trustcloud.com" target="_blank">TrustCloud</a> for instance.) Moreover, the same trend toward public reputation capital will ultimately make people more forgiving as we take more of an aggregate of the data when assessing others' trustworthiness. It seems as though engagement in the sharing economy does require exchanging old currencies for new intangible ones. The lesson here is that even as individuals, we should also seek to be pioneers rather than ostriches.
