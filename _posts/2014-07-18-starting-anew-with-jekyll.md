title: Starting Anew with Jekyll
---

It's about time for a new blog. 

In the interest of practicing some new languages and website building techniques, I decided to make the switch from WordPress to Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator. Simply put, Jekyll takes a template directory, runs it through markup language converters, and spits out a static HTML website. I've only been using it for a few days now, but I already love it. Here are a few reasons why.

**Fast and Free**

Performance-wise, Jekyll is blazing fast. Since static HTML is generated before you deploy to a web server rather than during each web request, blogs on Jekyll load very quickly and can easily handle upticks in traffic with no problem. I've never had an issue with heavy traffic and don't anticipate one, but I do love being able to click through my site with astonishing speed and know I'll never need to think about optimizing load times. 

Even in setup and maintenance, Jekyll is very efficient. It took about 10 minutes to set up this Jekyll blog from the initial download to deployment, and that's with some buffer time to configure the front matter. Instead of having to log in to a CMS each time you write a post, changes to the site can be made right in your favorite text editor and deployed to GitHub through a few entries on the command line. There is no dynamic back-end or clunky database or WYSIWYG text box every time I want to write. You don't even need WiFi! One of my favorite features is that you can serve up sites in your browser via localhost without an internet connection (I'm writing this on a rooftop). 

And as much as I liked paying DreamHost every year, the best part of it all is that GitHub Pages hosts Jekyll sites for free -- a huge draw for me both because of the price tag and because I have an excuse for more practice with Git. Did I mention version control is already built into the system? 

**Minimal Design**

Given that Jekyll emphasizes leanly structured, bare-bones static sites, it makes sense that many of the themes that exist out there are pretty minimal. This is a great thing.

Having spent too much time half-heartedly recycling website designs every few months with the intention of one day perfecting the layout, I've finally landed on a clean, minimal look too. I chose <a href="http://getpoole.com/" target="_blank">Poole</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/mdo" target="_blank">Mark Otto</a>, developed to "provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site," which makes this blog not too far off from the initial vanilla Jekyll install. Over time, this may change as I begin to tweak and add visual diversity. But as you can see, apart from the minor CSS additions to the one-column layout, there is currently little in the way of actual styling.    

Part of that decision was a result of my haste to start writing. But I also love the abundant white space and lack of showy design elements, which allows for interesting experimentation with typeface and emphasizes the words and content as the most important component. It feels like a blank slate, a symbol of an endless array of possibilities. It's difficult to scale back from an elaborate layout, but with less to start with, I can eventually take the look-and-feel in many directions. Poole favors minimalism and simplicity to the season's design trends, so I can worry less about keeping up. Finally, with no images to deal with, I'm left with what is naturally a very mobile-friendly, responsive website. Overall, a real winner.
