As brands increasingly migrate to the Internet to attract online sales, brick-and-mortar stores are waging war against “showrooming,” the consumer trend of “trying on” products in-store, then seeking lower prices online on websites such as Amazon.com. What I’m fascinated by is how certain brands have capitalized on this opportunity to transform traditionally retail-store-based industries by introducing new online distribution channels. <!-- more -->

One poignant example is Warby Parker, a primarily online boutique that sells vintage-inspired eyeglasses for about half the cost of designer frames. The folks at Warby Parker recognize that customers typically enjoy trying on glasses in a store before buying them, so they’ve instated the Home Try-On program, which allows customers to order five samples shipped to their home for free. By giving their customers this choice of at-home sampling, Warby Parker cleverly redefines showrooming to their advantage as a cheaper alternative to building and maintaining expensive brick-and-mortar stores. Opting for more of a direct sales approach, Warby Parker can then pass on the lower prices to their customers. The few flagship retail stores Warby Parker does own in New York actually serve to encourage showrooming and drive sales to the main channel of the WarbyParker.com website. 

Other retailers have hybridized the in-store shopping experience by configuring online order placement and in-store pickup options. In this way, customers have both the convenience of ordering from their computers and the instant gratification of an in-store purchase. Papa John’s enjoys an enormous sales volume online due to its fun online order form that visually allows customers to add their pizza toppings; customers then have the choice of pick-up at their local franchise or delivery. Similarly, Jamba Juice has recently partnered up with PayPal to allow customers to place an order and pay in advance before picking up the juices at their local store. Even large retail stores such as Walmart have captured sales simply by opening up online order and in-store pick-up options. 

With the huge growth in online shopping, retailers will need to leverage these shifts and adapt creatively to have a leg up in the industry. By seeking niche online shopper markets in traditionally brick-and-mortar-led industries, or by hybridizing the in-store experience, several retailers have demonstrated game-changing strategies to adjust to ever-evolving consumer demands.
