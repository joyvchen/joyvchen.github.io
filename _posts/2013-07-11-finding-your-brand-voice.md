In branding and content marketing, many strategists talk about the importance to maintain a consistent, well-defined brand voice, but few will actually point out what that might look like. Perhaps this is because brand voice is something rarely defined and more readily “felt.” This post is my attempt to understand the importance of tone in overall branding (and a general ode to the flexibility and complexity of the English language). <!-- more -->

**What is brand voice?**

Let’s pick this phrase apart and consider each word on its own.

What’s brand? I remember reading [a great blog post from Harry Rosenbaum of Wolff Olins](http://blog.wolffolins.com/post/31927155482/brand-people) on what brand strategy (and by extension, a brand) actually is. He writes insightfully: 

_“Great brands are like people. Every person possesses certain personality traits; characteristics that are determinative of every thing that person does. […] It is fairly consistent; in most circumstances, at least consistent enough to unify the actions of that person within a clear personality. And like people, brands have certain ‘character traits’ that make up their ‘personality.’ This personality infuses each behavior of the brand.”_

That comparison of brands and people stuck with me (and it isn't the first time brands have been compared to people - see [this post](http://landor.com/#!/talk/articles-publications/articles/branding-explained-to-a-child-what-is-a-brand/) by Luc Speissor of Landor). If brands are like people, brands too can cultivate a voice. I say cultivate because a brand voice cannot be faked or forced without others sensing it isn’t genuine. It’s not simply “made” either – a voice is found and then fostered. 

What’s voice? For writers, voice describes an individual’s style of expressing himself or herself, usually through the written word. Likewise, a voice is what brands use to communicate with their target audiences; it’s described by its own distinctive tone, syntax, semantics, diction, and style that govern how the content is created. Just as people may have different ways of speaking in different situations, so brands may have a different tone of voice depending on the particular mood or occasion, the channel or medium through which the brand communicates, or the kind of audience. 

**What is a good brand voice, and what can it do for the brand?**

Fostering a good brand voice achieves a unified personality across all communications. 

A unified personality connotes reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty. Conversely, an inconsistent brand voice – one that contradicts itself or subverts expectations – will likely undermine any sense of trust a reader has in a brand. 

A great brand voice adapts to its target audience – but it doesn’t necessarily match it. For instance, a young Internet startup may choose to adopt a playful, casual tone of voice to connect with millennials (though it wouldn’t necessarily opt for chatspeak). A legal firm would be expected to produce more serious, professional copy to build trust with clients. The brand voice should align with the audience, but also have the flexibility to adapt to different scenarios without compromising consistency. 

The voice should be the expression of the values that define the organization. It will ultimately shape others’ perception of the brand through not only what is said but also how it is said. It should inspire not only customers but also employees to embody the values and culture of the brand. Brand voice, then, can play a large part in attracting and retaining a following. 

**What brands out there have great brand voice?**

It's easy to separate out the great brand voices; they are the most memorable ones. I've tried to compile a list of the brands that I remember simply because of a unique voice. I should put a disclaimer here: as a twenty-something interested in startups, dot-com companies, and generally all things digital, I tend to gravitate toward brands with a more casual, laid-back verbal identity. In any case, here are some examples of what I think are great brand voices and some personality traits I’d use to describe them.

_**Zappos**_ – friendly, conversational, reliable, casual, personal

Ex: Processing a return label

We just wanted to let you know that a UPS shipper has sent you a FREE electronic UPS Return Label. Cool, huh? This way beats having to stand in line somewhere. Think of all the things you can do with your newly-found free time!

_**Foursquare**_ – playful, curious, youthful, quirky

Ex: This is the copy for the Shutterbug badge: 

You’re a regular Ansel Adams! Whether you’re capturing the sun setting over the Siberian tundra, an adorable French Bulldog, or an artsy cappuccino foam shot (#nojudgements), your friends love your photo-worthy adventures. Keep snapping away!

_**Taco Bell**_ – witty, irreverent, down to party

Ex: Some recent tweets: 

- Friends are temporary. Taco Bell is forever.

-  #IDidntTextYouBackBecause you said you didn't like Taco Bell.

- Are you following us on @Instagram? If not, what are you doing with your life? http://www.instagram.com/tacobell 

_Huge Inc._ – snarky, witty, geeky, sophisticated

Ex: Some recent tweets: 

- Imaginary Well-Dressed Toddler exists in real life. Just, you know, #FYI. http://t.co/yBj8jKwoSy

- Busting the myth that there's nothing sexy about furniture assembly. http://huge.is/132pSgM 

- Now we can stop sitting at bars across Europe, weeping until someone gives us beer. http://huge.is/1amcxFw
