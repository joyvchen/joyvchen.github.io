Yesterday, as I was walking with my friend Céline through her home city of Lyon, France, I commented on the gray beanie she was wearing on her head. Being from around the Detroit area, I immediately recognized the large Carhartt logo and associated it with sturdy work wear, favored by construction workers, farmers, wranglers, and ’90s skater kids when Carhartt made a very brief appearance at Kohl’s stores. In other words, it indicated high function more than high fashion, which is what perplexed me, since Céline is one of the most fashion conscious people I know. <!-- more -->

What’s fascinating to me is that in the last few years, Carhartt has turned its long-established blue-collar brand image around and extended it to somewhat of a hipster/bobo label. Carhartt’s offshoot Work in Progress division, tailored to the younger crowd, has boutiques in practically every big city’s trendy quarter, including three in Paris, three in Milan, three in London, one in Tokyo, and one in NYC’s Soho. If you shop on Carhartt’s online store, you get a free Techno-Projekt mix CD by Berlin-based group Brandt Brauer Frick with every order - evidence that Carhartt is also marketing to 20-something urbanites as well as the 4H/NASCAR crowds they usually support. Céline tells me Carhartt’s very trendy in France, and I’ll believe a girl who spent 300 euro on a fur-trim jacket in Tokyo. Now that I think about it, I’ve been seeing more and more Carhartt on the East Coast as well, particularly in conjunction with young bearded guys, their fixies, and Herschel backpacks. 

Céline asked me if there are labels that are commonplace in the US and are particularly sought-after in France, and I told her that this was the case for Levi’s jeans too. People in France will pay a hefty premium on Levi’s jeans, which they’d purchase at a Levi’s boutique rather than your mall JCPenney’s. And it’s trendy! I always thought Levi’s were just your average pair of jeans, but Levi’s boasts stores on the Champs-Élysées as well as some other bourgeois areas.

I suppose the same could be said for many ‘luxury’ labels from France too that enjoy a special reputation in the States. Longchamp comes to mind - since my mother recently asked me to buy a tote for her in France since it’s much cheaper here - though as a trend, I think it’s on the brink of exhaustion on the East Coast right now. But what I think is fascinating is how much Europeans look to America for trend inspiration. Though there is definitely a clear French way of dress that’s wholly apart from American style, the big cities of NYC and Paris really do serve as nodes of cross-cultural contact, and you can see it as you people-watch on the street.
