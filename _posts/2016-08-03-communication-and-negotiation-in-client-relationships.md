title: Communication and Negotiation in Client Relationships
tags: [product-management]

I recently gave a talk to my fellow Product Managers at work about navigating client relationships. My company is a mobile app development agency partnering with clients in a variety of industries, and when our product teams collaborate, every PM, UXer, designer, engineer, and strategist is client-facing and needs to manage external demands. 

For us PMs, that means juggling the competing needs from the business, their users, and the members of the product team. How do we tiptoe the fine line when saying “yes” can make the client happy and saying “no” would better serve the interest of the product or the user?

Having recently gone through a project with a heavily involved client, these are the negotiation and problem solving tips that I found helpful when encountering roadblocks. 

**1) Listen actively and ask clarifying questions to understand the underlying need or issue.**

<i>It’s not about the thing.</i> I’m constantly surprised at how often a purported problem isn’t actually about the problem. Borrowing from a phrase I learned while at CreativeMornings, I often say, “it’s not about the thing” -- so it may be a workplace politics thing, a personal thing, or a cultural thing. 

During a particularly trying Design Review on one of my projects, our client product owner surprised us by saying she was disappointed in the designs shown in the review in a heated phone call and follow-up email. Up to that point, all communication had indicated everyone was on the same page. Confused and dejected, we regrouped and got on a phone call to listen closely and ask the question, “What did you mean when you provided this feedback?" 

It became clear that the problem wasn’t at all about the designs but about a more emotional need of wanting opinions heard and their sketch concepts implemented more directly in the prototypes. We resolved to include the client even more often in concepting phases and to outline clearly where we had made use of their ideas. 

With so many factors potentially at play, it’s our job as PMs to identify the underlying issue by speaking directly to the person and asking “Why? Where are you coming from? What did you mean when you said that?” If we can separate out the more immediate emotional, personal, or political issue first, we can reduce its impact on the product and tackle the actual problem head-on.   

**2) Do your homework, and empower the client or stakeholder with the same information you have.** 

Information is power in any negotiation, and sharing information that you’ve made the effort to gather is an exercise in spreading goodwill and achieving alignment.

When negotiating for a set of features for a recent project, our client had trouble prioritizing, cutting down our release scope, and understanding the development implications of each addition. To walk the client through the process, I met with several engineers and made a spreadsheet that helped to outline level of effort and specifications for each feature that we were considering, and I shared it with the partner so that she could access the same objective information I was seeing. 

Mapping the decision against this objective criteria, as well as being transparent about the information available, refocused the conversation on what will be good for the product and what is feasible in a limited timeframe, not what will help either side “win.” 

**3) Seek mutually beneficial outcomes, and speak in terms of what the other party stands to gain.**

The best kind of negotiation is when both parties leave having gained something. Once you have a clear understanding of what is important to the client, it’s easier to find a solution that can both address that need as well as benefit the product team’s agenda. 

For instance, when it became clear that the client was hesitant to extend our contract to accommodate additional work, it was then easier for me to suggest areas where the client was able to save time and money. We adjusted the backend workload to the frontend and had the backend team work on a easier feature we’d already devoted time to building. 

Even when both parties benefit, it’s always helpful to start out by outlining how the client can benefit from the solution. Understanding that each party is motivated by different incentives, framing your idea in terms of how it will help your specific audience goes a long way toward achieving buy-in. 

**4) Remember: it’s not about how I feel about it, it’s about what we can do for the product.**

If there's a disagreement during the course of developing a product, just remember that it may simply be a testament to just how invested in the project everyone is. The way around the roadblock is to push the discussion toward objective measures so that the people problem does not bleed into the actual problem. Remind yourself and your team that it's not about subjective opinions or feelings -- everyone is trying to achieve the same goal of building the best product possible. 

Communication and negotiation are learned skills that require continued practice, and people are complex human beings reacting differently under changing circumstances. Listening intently, reframing a solution as a way you can help, reviewing objective information together, and having empathy are effective ways to align stakeholder interests.
