title: My First Month as a Prolific PM
---

About a month ago, I joined the rapidly growing <a href="http://prolificinteractive.com" target="_blank">Prolific Interactive</a> team in DUMBO, Brooklyn as the newest Product Manager. It’s been a whirlwind to say the least -- I spent my first week on the job traveling to Philadelphia for a client kickoff, the new few onboarding to the project, and have since plunged right into the world of mobile technology. So, with several sprints under my belt, I’ve been able to reflect on these takeaways from my first few weeks on the job. <!-- more -->

**Agency Agile** 

Having experienced the challenges of introducing Scrum to a waterfall setting, one aspect of Prolific that has really impressed me is our adherence to agile principles. Agency workflows are typically difficult to reconcile with agile methodology: with strict deadlines, fixed-bid invoicing, and clear requirements, it’s often a difficult sell to the client to be as flexible as agile usually demands. 

I’ve so far been really impressed with the level of agility our team is able to achieve, despite being an agency. Through daily builds distributed through Jenkins and HockeyApp to our individual mobile devices, we’re actually able to deliver functional software early and continuously. Every single day, we see progress in the app as it evolves from a bare-bones prototype to fully designed working product.  

Another tenet of agile is frequent face-to-face team communication across disciplines and across client-agency lines. Our entire team (including our clients) self-organizes every morning with a daily stand-up to keep each other posted and hold each other accountable for our goals. Our designers regularly interface with the iOS developers in order to understand feasibility and technical limitations when drafting up new features. 

Finally, we fly by the seat of our pants, kicking off sprints with a planner to decide what the week’s work will be, rather than front-loading our project planning. Always shipping, we feel comfortable handing off designs to the engineers with the expectation that our design cycles are iterative and designs are continually improved, even late in development. 

On this last note, I think our team can do even more to cushion the impact of changing requirements, since we still do our best to meet deadlines and avoid backpedaling as much as possible; however, so far, I think that our feedback-integrated process still affords much more adaptability than your usual waterfall approach. At Prolific, there seems to be a happy medium between nailing down the exact deliverables and being open to change.  

**True Collaboration** 

The people I work with at Prolific are truly collaborative, team-oriented types, energized by any opportunity to push each other upward. And by people I work with, I don’t limit that group to just my colleagues; I mean client PMs, engineers, and stakeholders as well. 

My current project provides the perfect example of client partnership: in addition to having stakeholders participate in all daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planners, our engineers and designers also pair with their counterparts from the client side. For instance, we’ve been able to invite a new iOS engineer from our client team to our Brooklyn office for a week of project onboarding and pair programming with our own engineers. Our designers also regularly engage in reviews and brainstorm sessions with our client design team. When we’re not interfacing on-site or in morning stand-ups, team members from both sides are tossing around ideas, opinions, questions, and choice GIFs on our shared Slack channel. 

Client-agency relationships can sometimes verge on “us-versus-them,” though at Prolific, I’ve found that we default to sharing information over hiding it. A culture of transparency enables trust, rapid feedback loops, and free-flowing idea exchange between client and internal team. I personally love that clients and internal team members alike can feel an equal sense of ownership over the project. 

**Experimenting with Tools and Processes** 

Another thing that has been very refreshing for me has been the level of freedom I have to try out new methods. As every project team has a different dynamic, I’ve had the opportunity to experiment with workflows and processes that suit our team best and adapt them as we see fit. I think this results from our agile process, which allows for flexibility and continuous improvement even on the process level; on a broader scale, transparency within the organization opens up communication channels so that designers and engineers can approach me about new processes we’d like to try. 

Some things that we’ve finessed and implemented in the middle of the project include our QA workflow, our wireframe-free design process, and API/iOS engineer stand-ups. Many of these processes have arisen ad hoc from our biweekly retrospectives, during which we reflect on team wins and learnings, allowing us to quickly bounce back up with new ideas that might better facilitate the week’s sprint goals. 

I really like not necessarily having to decide on the “right” way to do things upfront and simply adapting to our specific project needs. I recognize it takes a lot of patience and trust from my team members to be willing to try new ideas, and so far, everyone has been very receptive on the whole. 

**An Emphasis on Users**

I’m really excited about the value placed on user research at Prolific. With each new feature, we go through an extensive process of brainstorming, researching, wireframing, prototyping, interviewing, and -- here’s the big thing -- putting these prototypes into the hands of actual consumers for testing. We’re not just making assumptions about what users want; we’re actually going out into the world and talking directly with dozens of people who will use our apps. Our interviewing process dives deep into user habits, needs and desires, probing what it is users say they want versus what they might truly want and not verbalize. During our testing, we record every action using Lookback and Appsee in order to gauge both facial expressions as well as interactions with the app. 

Pairing these findings with what we know from analytics and heat maps, our UX designers bridge quantitative data with qualitative assessments in order to capture the voice of the user in every single feature decision we make. For a PM, this people-centered process has been a great boon so far in validating new features throughout the course of our roadmap. 

**“Roles Aren’t Boundaries”** 

This is a phrase borrowed from one of our founders, which I find captures my experience at Prolific so far. PMs arguably have the most cross-functional role, connecting the dots across all disciplines in the project workflow. As someone who has always enjoyed being a generalist, I’ve loved not only supporting our designers in the creative process, but also being able to pull down the latest code from the repo and QA API responses through a HTTP proxy. Working closely with our UX designer, I’ve also been very involved in user interviewing/testing in order to make better product decisions. 

I’m neither an engineer nor a designer nor a user researcher, but having a good grasp of how things progress on multiple sides allows me to better speak the same language, which is crucial when I work on collecting requirements and writing stories with my teammates. On a personal level, my hope is to more effectively energize these working relationships and to become a more versatile member of our team as a result.
