title: What is Strategy? (and JTBD)

When I started reading about strategy and attempting to define it for myself, I came across [a gem of a blog post by Mike Arauz of Undercurrent](http://undercurrent.com/post/what-is-strategy/), and I continue to refer back to it from time to time. I love this article for its meta-analysis of “strategy” (all the while loosely using the five steps he outlines), and for its perspicacity when it comes to what defines bad strategy. <!-- more -->

Arauz describes strategy as “the practice of figuring out the best way to get from here to there,” complete with a five-step plan to tackle any obstacle. With each challenge, the strategy you develop must encompass 

     1) awareness of where you are now, 

     2) an idea of where you want to end up, 

     3) an assessment of what stands between you and your goal, 

     4) a decision about how to approach the situation, and 

     5) a specific course of action to take.

This seems intuitive (after all, isn’t this how most people solve real life problems?), but it’s just as easy to encounter several pitfalls. For one thing, beware of “fluff,” a “form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts and arguments,” as well as objectives that fail to address actual issues. Another is to confuse #4 and #5 – that is, ideation and execution – and some agencies only do one or the other. I can also see strategists potentially getting lost when their impatience or determination to execute #5 compromises their true understanding of #2. 

It’s in situations like this that I enjoy thinking about a sticky idea called JTBD, or Jobs To Be Done. I first heard about this when I watched [a rather unusual but memorable video featuring Clay Christensen and milkshakes](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6496.html). His main point is that buying a product is a lot like hiring it out to fulfill a particular job, and if companies can have the foresight to understand the job customers want done, they can innovate with a clear sense of where to end up (#2) first rather than jumping forward to a decision about how to approach the problem they don’t fully grasp yet (#4, #5). 

In Christensen’s example, he describes a fast-food chain that begins by segmenting the market by product and demographics, doing extensive research on the customer, and developing a tastier milkshake, only to realize sales didn’t improve. If the restaurant had simply focused its efforts on that job, that end goal it sought to achieve – if it had a better awareness of why customers were already buying the milkshakes (#1) instead of blindly shooting for a better milkshake (#5), it could have saved a lot of expense and time. 

This five-step plan will help inform my thinking as I continue to learn more about strategy, but, like all plans, it’s not perfect. Not all projects will be approached exactly the same way, and they shouldn’t be, either. Any important project will need a strategist’s nimble and careful eye to parse out the smaller nuances and make the judgment call on which of the above tactics to use, and how.
