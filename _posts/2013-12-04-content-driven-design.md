At Barrel, we’re working toward a **Content-Driven Design (CDD)** process. Rather than leaping straight from discovery phase into the visual design or development stages, we’re approaching our web projects with the content at the front of mind. Thinking about content earlier in the game allows us to be more strategic about our clients’ business goals and about the true driver of value on their websites: the information users seek.

I should define “content” and “design” before I start, since I’ve found they can mean a lot of things in the web design world. By content, I’m referring not to specific copy on a page, but to a higher-level awareness of the content types to be delivered. When I say design, I don’t mean the UX design or the information architecture; I’m talking about the final high-fidelity visual designs that are informed by the content strategy. We don’t get too granular about CDD – this isn’t about drawing a container box 500 pixels wide to fit a block of text that spans 400 pixels – rather, it’s an iterative framework that allows us to map out web design possibilities.

### Content-Driven Design at Barrel

Having worked on countless e-commerce and non-profit organization websites, the Barrel team has built an expertise around content that sells clients’ products, services, and programs. And so it made a lot of sense when our principal Pete formally presented the archetype of Content-Driven Design to our design team this week. Content-Driven Design pushes us to consider clients’ content before building the elements around it, and the long-term goal is to adapt CDD to the way we work at Barrel and make it our own proprietary process. 

The Barrel lens of Content-Driven Design posits that a website should have considered the five Content Types – **Story, Product, Social Proof, Thought Leadership, and Conversion** – which together create a complete picture of the organization and its offerings. When proceeding to the design phase, these Content Types are translated into **Content Elements**, or the actual interface pieces (buttons, videos, slideshows, text blocks, modals, etc.) on the website.

A preliminary audit of the Content Types that the client has and that the client lacks will inform what **Content Elements** are designed later. This part is as simple as exploring the current website and taking note of the pages and elements fulfilling each Content Type, then assessing which Content Types the website could use more or less of. We also double check to make sure that a client can sustainably generate necessary content so that we don’t end up with empty shells down the road. Though content goals and needs vary from client to client, we believe a great website will have considered all five content types.

By the end, Pete’s presentation on Content-Driven Design left me even more curious about the concept. It’s a sound idea, and I wanted to really understand why we were adopting this new strategy, why it succeeds versus the alternatives, where Content-Driven Design could potentially fall short, and how Barrel is using it to solve web design problems.

### Why Take a Content-First Design Approach

**Content is Unique** 

In a sea of one-size-fits-all WordPress themes and prototypical site layouts, the only thing that will differentiate the client’s website from the next is their content. A client’s history of how they came to be, the impact they’ve had in society, or their particular set of values all make up the brand’s unique DNA. By extension, what makes design truly original is the content contained within, as the design draws inspiration from the content.

If the goal of a website is to showcase the uniqueness of a brand and sell its one-of-a-kind product, diving straight into design phase would require assumptions about the content required that knock uniqueness dead. Digital agencies such as Barrel are in the business of custom-working each website to fit the client’s message, not the other way around. When you start with content, you are solving a brand new puzzle of creating a design that works only for that set of content, rather than merely jamming the content into a predefined space in a prefab template. Building a website from scratch starting with original content is never the easy route to take, but it ultimately makes for the better final product that competitors cannot copy.

**Semantic Relationship Between Content and Design**

Starting off with visual designs without an understanding of the content available often leads to designers and developers using “lorem ipsum” text until the client can provide marketing copy and media. This placeholder is dangerous because it reduces what should be valuable, information-rich text content into a mere visual design element – the shape of the content block. Perhaps the client has designated someone to write in a tone characteristic of their brand, but what good is the copy when the container designed to house it clashes visually with the written tone? Or maybe the client cannot yet provide the hero image, so the designer temporarily substitutes in a stock photo that has little to do with the rest of the website’s look and feel, unintentionally setting a completely mismatched color scheme and style. Using actual content and understanding what kind of language is used leads to a closer semantic relationship between the content and the resulting design.

**Design-First Approaches Are Costly**

Clients are often hasty to touch design deliverables because it’s exciting to tinker with beautiful colors, images, and typefaces – not to mention they’re eager to visualize how the brand will immediately be perceived by their users. The danger in this is that content then tends to fall by the wayside, losing out to the “I have to see it first!” excuse. Designers and developers may move forward with entire themes in a hurry to present a working prototype, only to discover giant gaps in the website down the road.

Later, the team scrambles to fit in the content the client has only just now provided but realizes they didn’t plan any space for the new slideshow or the set of gallery photos. Scope continues to creep out of control: what ensues are retroactive edits, brand new custom pages shoehorned into the original structure, and time-consuming meetings between designer and developer to reach new solutions. Worst of all, the new designs clash with the original designs, resulting in a “Frankenstein” hodgepodge look.

Obviously, this is an extreme case, but the tendencies and takeaways are the same. All the hassle could be avoided by understanding the content first and building the designs based on the content. Though taking time to understand the content is challenging in the beginning, in the long run, it’s the more time- and cost-effective way to pursue the project.

### When Does Content-Driven Design Break Down? 

Like any useful tool, the Content-Driven Design framework has its rules and limitations. As previously mentioned, Content-Driven Design isn’t applicable to every kind of website. We’ve found it most helpful for companies selling a complex product or organizations offering programs and services, but it wouldn’t support certain art projects, novelty sites, web apps, personal pages, etc.

The framework also puts more pressure on the client by front-loading as much of the content collection process as possible. The risk of pursuing Content-Driven Design is reaching a bottleneck if the client cannot provide content early enough due to a lack of resources on their end. Larger clients can usually avoid this hoopla because they usually have designated staff whose job is to develop content exclusively. Smaller clients may not have such luxuries, leading to choke points during the design process, or even unloading the content production task onto our internal team.

Given the kinds of clients we work with, I think Barrel is well-equipped to take on the risk of pursuing Content-Driven Design. The rewards of successfully using the framework are huge: the agency saves time and money by avoiding costly backtracking, and the client receives a final product that is better suited to their needs.

What remains to be seen is how Barrel will make the CDD framework scalable as clients and their websites need to gracefully accommodate new products, features, and content – all the while saving time and effort by avoiding building completely from scratch. We’re currently experimenting with a happy medium: Barrel Now, a modular WordPress framework that constructs a unique website through a combination of standardized content types. With Barrel Now, we are hoping to afford as much attention to content specificity as to repeatable process.
