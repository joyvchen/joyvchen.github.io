title: A Day in the Life of a Product Manager

A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to participate in <a href="http://www.moccasin.me/" target="_blank">Project Moccasin</a>, a day-long product and design mentorship program organized by Phoebe (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/femmebot/" target="_blank">@femmebot</a>). Through the program, I was able to spend a day in the life of Etsy Product Manager <a href="http://www.douglashwang.com/" target="_blank">Doug Hwang</a>, shadowing him as he led standups, participated in retrospectives, and gathered requirements across various teams. Experiencing product management first-hand at a large, established tech company helped me better understand the role as adapted to different settings. I wanted to reflect a bit about this incredible mentorship opportunity, as well as share some advice that Doug passed along to me for aspiring Product Managers. <!-- more -->

**What was it like to shadow a Product Manager at Etsy?** 

When I filled out the Project Moccasin pairing questionnaire, I was hoping to shadow in an environment that was vastly different from what I’d previously experienced in order to get a sense of the full spectrum of PM roles. This was definitely the case at Etsy. Though standup meetings, backlog discussions, retrospectives, and one-on-ones mostly took the same format as the ones I’d been used to, I was still surprised by the sheer scale at which these processes took place. 

Having worked at a small agency and an even smaller startup previously, the first thing I noticed at Etsy was how enormous the company was in comparison, and how much the size of the company affects the culture and the team structure. Not only did PMs have their own product teams, they were also a part of a team of product managers that had their own leaders and focus areas. I think the sheer size of the company created a sense of busyness around the building, given more people to update, the probability of remote teams, and a constant flow of meetings to facilitate communication. Speaking with a member of the marketing team wasn’t just a casual tap-on-the-shoulder; it required a scheduled, timeboxed meet time as well as a short walk to another wing of the building. I’d later understand that even just maintaining remote teams poses its own set of unique challenges, from coordinating time and communication to building the right rapport with your team. I imagine that larger companies generally have a more structured approach to daily communications, which helps them stay efficient at scale. 

What I believe might also be true as a result of this large organizational structure is the opportunity to individually specialize. In this case, Doug’s own expertise happens to be data and analytics, and so, he works closely with data analysts on growth metrics and SEO, for instance. On the other hand, at the smaller companies I’ve been at, there seems to be a larger focus on consistency across members of the same team as well as a need for generalists who can wear many hats. For me, this has been especially true of agency work, where consistent, repeatable process drives growth in the company, and the lack of entire departments has meant I’ve needed to be a product manager, business development associate, project manager, account manager, and community manager at different times during the role.

It was also clear that big data ruled at Etsy, and to no surprise, being an enormous online marketplace facilitating a heavy volume of traffic and sales around the world each day. The scale of the company affords entire teams around these databases, though it’s not just data specialists running queries; Etsy PMs also regularly get to extract data as well. For PMs, the benefits of having large quantities of behavioral and transactional data at hand are huge: having it allows you to validate product decisions with conviction, monitor long-term impact, and conduct experiments for new features. In my experience, opportunities to work with big data are a luxury for small shops. I’ve been able to work with smaller datasets for validation purposes, but they often need to be cross-checked with other findings from qualitative user research due to limited sample sizes. So, experiencing Doug’s interactions with data analysts from the marketing team was a neat look into how Etsy employees of all disciplines can regularly touch the complex, real-time big data that underlies the platform.  

Finally, I was lucky to shadow on a day when there were several internal events going on at Etsy. One that stuck out to me was a series of lightning talks by Etsy employees on topics of their choice. It proved that an incredible diversity exists at Etsy (in terms of interests, hobbies, and backgrounds, more than just demographics). From one employee’s hilarious account of “why cats are very cute,” to another’s interpretation of Anna Karenina translations, to Doug’s own take on big data in sports, the lightning talks demonstrated a vibrant energy that exists at Etsy around sharing and being curious about the world. To create and maintain that kind of culture in a company of over 600 employees is rather impressive. 

**Advice for Aspiring Product Managers**

At the end of the day, Doug shared with me some advice for those like me hoping to break into product management, or otherwise becoming a better PM. I asked him about what kinds of skills I should focus on developing, what kind of company setting might be beneficial, and how to keep on improving my craft. Some takeaways from our conversation and following discussions: 

<i>On breaking into product management and becoming a great product manager:</i>

* <i>Data is king:</i> Product management can be approached from many different angles, and many PMs have a particular bent for engineering, business, design, or data. Doug suggested that a great route into product management is to learn as much about data as possible -- especially being able to write your own SQL queries, which means the PM won’t need to completely rely on an Analyst every time. Data is crucial for backing up product decisions, and it’s something that every good PM will need to understand how to analyze through and through. 


* <i>Know the user:</i> Another route to PM is to understand the user of a particular product as well as possible (i.e. excelling in a customer support role), because at the end of the day, PMs need to both understand user needs and have the data to support the decisions they make.  


* <i>Keep learning and doing:</i> What I find exciting (and challenging) about the tech world is its constantly evolving nature, which forces PMs most of all to stay on top of industry happenings. And I’ve heard this from Doug and other PMs: the best product managers are beta testers for a lot of new products and obsessively read TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Lifehacker, etc. 

<i>On product management company settings:</i>

* <i>Agency life:</i> If you’re considering product management roles at an agency, make sure that you’re enough of a true Product Owner. This means making decisions that will affect the product over the long term, looking to users for input, and iterating on that product. This can be tricky if you’re working closely with clients, who sometimes take on a heavier product ownership role, and if you work on a project-by-project basis, which means you might not return to an already-launched product.  


* <i>Startups vs. Large, Established Companies:</i> Choosing between working at a startup versus a large company will depend on personal preference. At a big company, you might be a very small part of a big machine, whereas you might have more product exposure at a small company. Both could afford exposure to “product,” however.  


* <i>NYC vs SF:</i> if you’re serious about tech, Silicon Valley has an unparalleled environment, opportunities, and people. Though Doug has himself thrived in the NYC digital community, he described the SF/Silicon Valley area as fertile soil for personal and professional development in tech. 

**On Mentorship**

More than anything, I feel very fortunate to take part in the Project Moccasin mentorship program, and I strongly believe it’s just the kind of thing the industry needs much more of. Regardless of what stage you are in your career, mentorship can provide valuable perspective and help you become better at what you do. I learned an incredible amount just from the day spent shadowing (Thanks Doug! Thanks Phoebe!), not to mention from many other PMs who have helped me in the past year. Though I’m still grooming myself into the best product manager I can be, I hope and strive to pass along my learnings to other people hoping getting started in their careers.
