title: The Future of Collaborative Consumption

**Sharing is the New Buying**

Having provided and surfed on couches abroad through CouchSurfing, booked a private Airbnb room, hailed an Uber driver, connected to the internet via Karma, funded Kickstarter projects, and rented a private study for a few hours through Breather, I've gotten by over the last few years owning little in the way of personal belongings. With the advent of rapid online communications, social networks, and near-instant payment systems, we're now able to share and repurpose idle resources as widely as ever. We've come a long way, but how did we get here? 

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, a growing concern around resource scarcity has caused consumers to turn to peer-to-peer sharing platforms to activate previously underutilized assets. Compound that factor with rampant urbanization and the fact that, for <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/urban_health/situation_trends/urban_population_growth_text/en/" target="_blank">the first time ever, the majority of the world lives in cities</a>; our densely connected populations favor mesh businesses and efficient solutions for making cities more habitable. Finally, we live in a time when trust between individual sellers and buyers is at an all-time high: having long cast away our fears of shopping and sharing personal information online, we're now readily willing to share goods and services with complete strangers. Such behaviors fundamentally redefine the buyer-seller relationship, and forward-thinking companies must engage in the participatory culture or risk disintermediation by C2C exchanges. 

**Disrupt or Get Disrupted**

For companies, particularly ones in more traditional industries with legacy practices, the time to participate is now. How can incumbent companies achieve this, if their own business models do not readily enable collaboration? 

One way is to partner with existing platforms that encourage crowd behaviors. A recent example is the partnership between electronics giant GE and crowd-sourced invention startup Quirky, which outsources the costly R&D process to the Quirky inventor community and borrows GE's existing supply chain to produce and distribute products at scale, such as the Aros air conditioner and Wink, a line of smartphone-connected home appliances. Quirky's collaborative platform enables everyday inventors to submit new ideas and vote for their favorites, allowing the community to influence all steps of the product development process. The result is a rapid prototype-to-market process thanks to Quirky, and GE's corporate IP, experienced QA programming, and regulatory compliance knowledge. 

Another co-branded initiative is the West Elm and Etsy partnership, which allows the former to tap into Etsy's online artisan marketplace and offer a broader, local product line at its retail stores and catalogs. Meanwhile, Etsy sees an opportunity to pursue wholesale and connect its independent marketplace sellers with national, retail-friendly audiences.  

We will see more of these collaborations emerge as legacy corporations seek new ways to participate in a market fueled by changing consumer preferences for peer-to-peer alternatives. Meanwhile, online marketplaces and platforms still need to close the gap between the technological generation and those still clinging onto traditional, "brick-and-mortar" models of doing business.
