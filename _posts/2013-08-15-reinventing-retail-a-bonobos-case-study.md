Previously, I wrote on [brands innovating the showroom](/2013/04/08/brands-innovating-the-showroom/) with a focus on e-commerce retailers turning to clever brick-and-mortar solutions. I've recently been eyeing another "e-tailer" that is making waves for its unique business model that embraces showrooming and its perceptive understanding of its consumer base: the online menswear label [Bonobos](http://bonobos.com). Bonobos is - like Warby Parker - one of the first in a larger trend of retailers attempting to hybridize the digital and physical shopping experience. I'm convinced that Bonobos will be a brand to watch and learn from in the near future, as it's doing a number of things right. 

**1) Bonobos is based off an understanding of the customer and what he wants**

Bonobos excels because it initially focused not on product or on distribution, but on the customer first. One look at Bonobos's website and it's obvious which demographic it caters to: male Millennials who find the retail experience a hassle. After surveying its top customers, Bonobos managed to build the company around some key insights about this target audience, best represented by this equation:

This equation describes male shopping behavior: men primarily seek a great fit and a decent style, though they prefer that time and hassle be minimized. Because of their focus on fit, men will also develop a loyalty to a retailer that offers clothing that fits them well, effectively reducing the time and hassle spent on shopping around. These insights led to an emphasis on perfectly fitting pants that customers could purchase online and have delivered in 1-2 days to their doorstep. By knowing the needs of the customer, Bonobos was then able to then deliver a product tailored exclusively for the customer as well as a number of strategic channels.

**2) Bonobos is experience-centric, not distribution-centric** 

If Bonobos has a strong understanding of its customer, it makes sense that its specially designed retail experience is built around quality customer service. Unlike traditional retail stores, Bonobos asks customers to make an hour-long appointment for a personalized visit to one of its brick-and-mortar "Guideshops," brilliantly separating out the shoppers already interested enough to book a slot in the first place. Bonobos representatives, attractive young people who are playfully titled "Ninjas," woo customers with a beer as well as a one-on-one fitting.  With only a few people in the store at any given time, Ninjas can afford shoppers much more attention as they try on every style. [Yelp's page for a Manhattan Bonobos Guideshop](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bonobos-manhattan-2) suggests that on the whole, people love the care they receive. It pays off too: order values in Guideshops are double what they are online, and customers are less likely to return products and more likely to make repeat transactions. 

The lesson here: in order to succeed in a saturated retail market, it’ll take more than product innovation in order to sell to customers. Retailers are now focusing much more on selling a unique experience, and as in the case of Bonobos, some are completely reinventing it.     

**3) Bonobos benefits from both online _and_ traditional channels**

Sure, Bonobos rocks online – it has leveraged the sheer scale of the Internet to grow meteorically ([described in 2010 as “the internet’s fastest growing men’s clothing retailer”](http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/bonobos-secures-185m-funding-round-from-lightspeed-venture-partners-accel-partners-1370286.htm)). For another, it rides on the successes of the Zappos model by providing free shipping and returns as well as premium customer service online, which people love. With [Millennials](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Millennials-Shop-Online/1010031) (aged 18-34) more likely than older generations (aged 35-64) to engage in nearly every shopping activity, and 40% of male Millennials saying they would buy everything online if they could, Bonobos's e-commerce focus also caters directly to its target audience. 

Yet while e-commerce is blazing the way to the future of shopping, there are still products that people want to touch and feel before making their purchases: clothing, for one thing. Bonobos recognizes that some may not be shopping online yet. This is why the hybridized Guideshop works so well. After the fitting session during which customers try on all kinds of clothing, Bonobos associates check out shoppers via laptop or mobile device and email sizing information so shoppers can continue from their home computers. 

A main success of this model is in reducing overhead: fewer Ninjas are needed to man the store, Ninjas don’t waste time restocking storerooms, and stores require less square footage. From the customer’s perspective, there’s no need to lug a huge bag of purchases back home, there’s the ease of repeat purchases that comes with knowing sizing info, and after a whole hour spent on concerted playtime with the brand, I think it’d be unlikely that a shopper leaves without purchasing something on the first run. (Think of how women given ‘free makeup’ service at the department store feel pressured to purchase a kit, or how customers asking for flavor samples feel the need to buy a whole ice cream cone.) 

Outside of the online/offline Guideshop, Bonobos hasn’t forgotten those who shop nearly exclusively offline, and that’s why [a 2012 partnership with Nordstrom is significant](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/stores-go-online-to-find-a-perfect-fit/?ref=business). This "symbiotic deal" raised $16.4 M in cash for Bonobos as well as over 100 Nordstrom outlets to sell its clothing – bringing the brand closer to customers who may not have heard of Bonobos online or don’t live in the big cities near Guideshops. 

**So what's next for Bonobos?**

[Word on the street](https://twitter.com/Bonobos/status/344613051670097921) is that Bonobos has a women’s line in the works. With its roots in menswear staples and specifically chinos, I’m curious to see how Bonobos will adapt its business model, since women’s clothing is often much less standardized in size and style than men’s clothing. Not to mention women have quite different expectations from men when shopping - this image is brilliant in illustrating a new kind of customer behavior Bonobos must understand:

Will Bonobos be able to offer the trends, style, and fit women seek, while maximizing the fun of the experience? There will be more wiggle room, as time and hassle aren't a big problem as long as Bonobos can provide something fashionable (women derive utility from entertainment value and more frequent 'fun' purchases). As a female Millennial, I'm personally quite excited to see how Bonobos will deliver on this challenge.
