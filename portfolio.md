I've been lucky enough to be a part of some great collaborations with incredibly talented people. Here are just a few of my favorite work and personal projects.

## Ellevate (formerly 85 Broads)<br />

When 85 Broads rebranded as Ellevate, the global professional women's network sought a redesigned visual identity and robust new website to accompany the organization's shift. Incorporating agile principles, I worked with a strong team of UX/visual designers and developers on building a Ruby on Rails membership app that could support Ellevate's globally distributed chapters and events as well as serve a wide range of editorial and video content.

## Shake<br />

Shake is a technology platform that offers legal assistance and resources to consumers, freelancers, and small businesses. By redesigning their marketing site with an eye toward increasing app signups as well as highlighting their blog as a trusted source of legal advice, my team was able to help Shake promote its mission of making the law accessible for everyone.
