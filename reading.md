title: Reading 
---
These are reads I am currently enjoying or have finished recently. Most of the things I like to read are related to tech, design, cities, psychology, art, or culture. In addition to news and industry happenings, I rarely pass up a good piece on gender issues in tech, urbanization/modernization in China, French politics and culture, the Millennial generation, and the evolution of cities.
