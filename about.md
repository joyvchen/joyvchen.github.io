title: Hey there, I'm Joy. 
---
Michigan born and raised, I now live in NYC working at the intersection of art and technology. Within this space, I enjoy thinking and learning about product, process, UX, and how to make features that combine form and function for users. I studied art history and French at Yale, so visual storytelling, aesthetics, and research form the basis of my thinking. Previously a digital project manager with a bent for web apps, I'm currently focused on building better tools for organizers of <a href="http://creativemornings.com" target="_blank">CreativeMornings</a>, a globally distributed lecture series for creative types. 

Outside of my work, my current interests are teaching myself to code and long-distance running. I'm also an urban/backcountry backpacker, regular art museum goer, and coffee lover. Finally, I'm a big fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryDOy3AosBw&feature=kp" target="_blank">the 90s</a>. 

## About This Site

This site was created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a simple, Ruby-powered static site generator that parses Liquid template files and Markdown content. It is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. (Here's an <a href="/2014/07/18/starting-anew-with-jekyll/">ode</a> I've written on the wonders of Jekyll.) 

I started this blog because I've kept some form of a journal for as long as I can remember. I believe writing makes you a clearer thinker, and I've always deeply admired those who could express themselves eloquently with the written word.

## Let's Talk

I love meeting new people over coffee. If you're in NYC, <a href="mailto:chenjoyv@gmail.com" target="_blank">email me</a> and we could meet up to chat.
