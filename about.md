title: Hey there, I'm Joy. 
---
You'll find me in NYC working at the intersection of creativity and technology. Currently, I'm a Product Manager at <a href="http://www.prolificinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Prolific Interactive</a>, where I work with talented teams to build awesome mobile experiences. I've most recently worked on improving online tools for organizers of <a href="http://creativemornings.com" target="_blank">CreativeMornings</a>, a global, monthly lecture series for the creative community; prior to that, I was a digital project manager at Barrel, shipping responsive websites and web apps. Before moving to the city, I studied French literature and art history at Yale. 

I like: Internet culture, art museums, coffee, backcountry hiking/camping, world travel, good food, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryDOy3AosBw&feature=kp" target="_blank">the 90s</a>. 

## About This Site

This site was created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a simple, Ruby-powered static site generator that parses Liquid template files and Markdown content. It is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. (Here's a brief <a href="/2014/07/18/starting-anew-with-jekyll/">ode</a> I've written on the wonders of Jekyll.) 

I started this blog because I've kept some form of a journal for as long as I can remember. I believe writing makes you a clearer thinker, and I've always deeply admired those who could express themselves eloquently with the written word.

## Let's Talk

I really love meeting new people over coffee, as well as finding ways I can help. If you're in NYC, <a href="mailto:chenjoyv@gmail.com" target="_blank">email me</a> and we could meet up to chat!
