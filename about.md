title: Hey there, I'm Joy. 
---
You'll find me in NYC working at the intersection of strategy, design, and technology. Currently, I'm a Sr. Product Manager at <a href="http://www.prolificinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Prolific Interactive</a>, where I work with cross-functional teams to build awesome, user-centric mobile experiences. 

My current interests outside my professional work include cycling, running, the outdoors, travel, and the French language. 

## Let's Talk

I enjoy meeting new people over coffee, as well as finding ways I can help. If you're in NYC, <a href="mailto:chenjoyv@gmail.com" target="_blank">email me</a> and we could meet up to chat!
